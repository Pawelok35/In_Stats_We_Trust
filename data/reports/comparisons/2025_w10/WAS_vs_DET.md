_Off EPA = średnie EPA/play ataku (wyżej = lepiej). Def EPA = średnie EPA/play oddawane przez obronę (niżej = lepiej). Off SR/Def SR = % udanych akcji. Tempo = jak szybko gra atak._

## Betting Angle / What Stands Out

- Tempo gap: kto gra szybciej → więcej snapów, więcej okazji do punktów.
- Defense trend: porównaj Def EPA last 3 obu drużyn.
- Offense trend: czy ofensywa rośnie czy spada względem całego sezonu.
